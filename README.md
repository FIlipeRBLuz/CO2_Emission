# CO2_Emission
Description - This notebook was developed aims to predict CO2 emission using regression technics based on other features. It was part of Radix challenging. - The challenge was cool to solve, creating the necessity of reading about the subject, trying to improve my knowledge about CO2 emission and also about new technics to solve the questions. - I tried to be innovative using new methods, enjoying the opportunity to learn more about regression models, hypothesis tests and plotting results.
